    <h1> What is Blindness?</h1>
    

    <p>Blindness is a lack of vision. It may also refer to a loss of vision that cannot be corrected with glasses or contact lenses.Partial blindness means you have very limited vision.Complete blindness means you cannot see anything and DO NOT see light. (Most people who use the term "blindness" mean complete blindness.) People with vision that is worse than 20/200 with glasses or contact lenses are considered legally blind in most states in the United States.Vision loss refers to the partial or complete loss of vision. This vision loss may happen suddenly or over a period of time.Some types of vision loss never lead to complete blindness.<br><br>

        <strong>Vision loss has many causes. In the United States, the leading causes are:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Accidents or injuries to the surface of the eye (chemical burns or sports injuries)</li>
            <li>Diabetes</li>
            <li>Glaucoma</li>
            <li>Macular degeneration</li>
        
        </ul>
<p>
    <strong>The type of partial vision loss may differ, depending on the cause:</strong>

        <ul>
            <li>Accidents or injuries to the surface of the eye (chemical burns or sports injuries)</li>
            <li>Diabetes</li>
            <li>Glaucoma</li>
            <li>Macular degeneration</li>
        </ul>  
        
 <p>   
With cataracts, vision may be cloudy or fuzzy, and bright light may cause glare
With diabetes, vision may be blurred, there may be shadows or missing areas of vision, and difficulty seeing at night. With glaucoma, there may be tunnel vision and missing areas of vision. With macular degeneration, the side vision is normal, but the central vision is slowly lost. <br><br>
     
<strong>Other causes of vision loss include:</strong>

     <ul>
        <li>Blocked blood vessels</li>
        <li>Complications of premature birth (retrolental fibroplasia)</li>
        <li>Complications of eye surgery</li>
        <li>Lazy eye</li>
        <li>Optic neuritis</li>
        <li>Stroke</li>
        <li>Retinitis pigmentosa</li>
        <li>Tumors, such as retinoblastoma and optic glioma</li>
    </ul>
        
        
        <p><strong>Total blindness (no light perception) is often due to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Severe trauma or injury</li>
<li>Complete retinal detachment</li>
<li>End-stage glaucoma</li>
<li>End stage diabetic retinopathy</li>
<li>Severe internal eye infection (endophthalmitis)</li>
<li>Vascular occlusion (stroke in the eye)</li>
</ul>

    <h2> Your Task</h2>
        <p>You will see a black screen to simulate being unable to see anything. Your task is to navigate to the blindness article within the page. You can only utilize the screenreader and your keyboard to help you navigate to the page and hear the article. To make the task even more tough, you can close your eyes altogether, finding each keyboard to press by the sense of touch, as those with blindness do. While you can navigate the following website with your keyboard, keep in mind that some websites do not design for keyboard compatibility, so for the blind some websites are even more difficult to access.
        Navigate to the Glaucoma page and hear the article. Then click take quiz to exit the task and test how much you were able to understand about Glaucoma.

    <h2> Screen Readers</h2>
        <p>

            For this task we will focus on utilizing the screenreader already available to anyone who has a Mac: Apple VoiceOver.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Follow the steps below to use VoiceOver on your Mac.</strong><br><br>
            
            1. Click the apple icon on the top left of your screen. Select system preferences.<br><br>

            2. Click on the accessibility icon.<br><br>
            <img src="../resources/step%202.png" id="imgstep1"><br>
            3. On the left you will see many options (General, Voiceover, Zoom. Display, etc.),choose Voiceover.<br><br>
            <img src="../resources/step3.png" id="imgstep1"><br>
            <img src="../resources/step4.png" id=imgstep1><br>
            4. In the VoiceOver window you will get the choice to check a box that says Enable VoiceOver. Check that.Then a window will pop up asking you again if you want to enable VoiceOver, click Use VoiceOver.<br>
            <img src="../resources/step5.png" id=imgstep1><br>
            
            
            If you would like to learn more about how to use Voicover you can also click on the Open VoiceOver Training on the bottom of the VoiceOver window. <br><br>However, for now you only need to know 3 keyboard buttons: Tab to go to the next item on the screen (keep in mind that once you are at the end of the screen if you click tab it will take you to the top of the screen again), enter to click on a link or button, and shift+tab to go back to the previous item on the webpage.
