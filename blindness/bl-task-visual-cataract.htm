        A cataract is a clouding of the normally clear lens of your eye. For people who have cataracts, seeing through cloudy lenses is a bit like looking through a frosty or fogged-up window. Clouded vision caused by cataracts can make it more difficult to read, drive a car (especially at night) or see the expression on a friend's face.<br><br>

        Most cataracts develop slowly and don't disturb your eyesight early on. But with time, cataracts will eventually interfere with your vision.<br><br>

        At first, stronger lighting and eyeglasses can help you deal with cataracts. But if impaired vision interferes with your usual activities, you might need cataract surgery. Fortunately, cataract surgery is generally a safe, effective procedure.<br><br>

        <strong>Symptoms</strong><br><br>
        Signs and symptoms of cataracts include:<br><br>

        Clouded, blurred or dim vision<br>
        Increasing difficulty with vision at night<br>
        Sensitivity to light and glare<br>
        Need for brighter light for reading and other activities<br>
        Seeing "halos" around lights<br>
        Frequent changes in eyeglass or contact lens prescription<br>
        Fading or yellowing of colors<br>
        Double vision in a single eye<br><br>
            
        At first, the cloudiness in your vision caused by a cataract may affect only a small part of the eye's lens and you may be unaware of any vision loss. As the cataract grows larger, it clouds more of your lens and distorts the light passing through the lens. This may lead to more noticeable symptoms.<br><br>

            <strong>Causes</strong><br><br>
        Most cataracts develop when aging or injury changes the tissue that makes up your eye's lens.<br><br>

        Some inherited genetic disorders that cause other health problems can increase your risk of cataracts. Cataracts can also be caused by other eye conditions, past eye surgery or medical conditions such as diabetes. Long-term use of steroid medications, too, can cause cataracts to develop.<br><br>

        How a cataract forms<br><br>
        The lens, where cataracts form, is positioned behind the colored part of your eye (iris). The lens focuses light that passes into your eye, producing clear, sharp images on the retina — the light-sensitive membrane in the eye that functions like the film in a camera.<br><br>

        As you age, the lenses in your eyes become less flexible, less transparent and thicker. Age-related and other medical conditions cause tissues within the lens to break down and clump together, clouding small areas within the lens.<br><br>

        As the cataract continues to develop, the clouding becomes denser and involves a bigger part of the lens. A cataract scatters and blocks the light as it passes through the lens, preventing a sharply defined image from reaching your retina. As a result, your vision becomes blurred.<br><br>

        Cataracts generally develop in both eyes, but not evenly. The cataract in one eye may be more advanced than the other, causing a difference in vision between eyes.<br><br>

        <strong>Types of cataracts</strong><br><br>
        Cataract types include:<br><br>

        Cataracts affecting the center of the lens (nuclear cataracts). A nuclear cataract may at first cause more nearsightedness or even a temporary improvement in your reading vision. But with time, the lens gradually turns more densely yellow and further clouds your vision.<br><br>

        As the cataract slowly progresses, the lens may even turn brown. Advanced yellowing or browning of the lens can lead to difficulty distinguishing between shades of color.<br><br>

        Cataracts that affect the edges of the lens (cortical cataracts). A cortical cataract begins as whitish, wedge-shaped opacities or streaks on the outer edge of the lens cortex. As it slowly progresses, the streaks extend to the center and interfere with light passing through the center of the lens.<br><br>
            
        Cataracts that affect the back of the lens (posterior subcapsular cataracts). A posterior subcapsular cataract starts as a small, opaque area that usually forms near the back of the lens, right in the path of light. A posterior subcapsular cataract often interferes with your reading vision, reduces your vision in bright light, and causes glare or halos around lights at night. These types of cataracts tend to progress faster than other types do.
        Cataracts you're born with (congenital cataracts). Some people are born with cataracts or develop them during childhood. These cataracts may be genetic, or associated with an intrauterine infection or trauma.<br><br>

        These cataracts also may be due to certain conditions, such as myotonic dystrophy, galactosemia, neurofibromatosis type 2 or rubella. Congenital cataracts don't always affect vision, but if they do they're usually removed soon after detection.<br><br>

        Risk factors<br><br>
        Factors that increase your risk of cataracts include:<br><br>

        Increasing age<br>
        Diabetes<br>
        Excessive exposure to sunlight<br>
        Smoking<br>
        Obesity<br>
        High blood pressure<br>
        Previous eye injury or inflammation<br>
        Previous eye surgery<br>
        Prolonged use of corticosteroid medications<br>
        Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol<br>
