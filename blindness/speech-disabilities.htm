       Speech disorders affect a person’s ability to form the sounds that allow them to communicate with other people. They are not the same as language disorders.

Speech disorders prevent people from forming correct speech sounds, while language disorders affect a person’s ability to learn words or understand what others say to them.

However, both speech and language disorders can make it more difficult for a person to express their thoughts and feelings to others.

Types
Speech disorders can affect people of all ages.

Some types of speech disorder include stuttering, apraxia, and dysarthria. We discuss each of these types below:

Stuttering
Stuttering refers to a speech disorder that interrupts the flow of speech. People who stutter can experience the following types of disruption:

Repetitions occur when people involuntarily repeat sounds, vowels, or words.
Blocks happen when people know what they want to say but have difficulty making the necessary speech sounds. Blocks may cause someone to feel as though their words are stuck.
Prolongations refer to the stretching or drawing out of particular sounds or words.
The symptoms of stuttering can vary depending on the situation. Stress, excitement, or frustration can cause stuttering to become more severe. Some people may also find that certain words or sounds can make a stutter more pronounced.

Stuttering can cause both behavioral and physical symptoms that occur at the same time. These can include:

tension in the face and shoulders
rapid blinking
lip tremors
clenched fists
sudden head movements
There are two main types of stuttering:

Developmental stuttering affects young children who are still learning speech and language skills. Genetic factors significantly increase a person’s likelihood of developing this type of stutter.
Neurogenic stuttering occurs when damage to the brain prevents proper coordination between the different regions of the brain that play a role in speech.
Apraxia
The brain controls every single action that people make, including speaking. Most of the brain’s involvement in speech is unconscious and automatic.

When someone decides to speak, the brain sends signals to the different structures of the body that work together to produce speech. The brain instructs these structures how and when to move to form the appropriate sounds.

For example, these speech signals open or close the vocal cords, move the tongue and shape the lips, and control the movement of air through the throat and mouth.

Apraxia is a general term referring to brain damage that impairs a person’s motor skills, and it can affect any part of the body. Apraxia of speech, or verbal apraxia, refers specifically to the impairment of motor skills that affect an individual’s ability to form the sounds of speech correctly, even when they know which words they want to say.

Dysarthria
Dysarthria occurs when damage to the brain causes muscle weakness in a person’s face, lips, tongue, throat, or chest. Muscle weakness in these parts of the body can make speaking very difficult.

People who have dysarthria may experience the following symptoms:

slurred speech
mumbling
speaking too slowly or too quickly
soft or quiet speech
difficulty moving the mouth or tongue


Symptoms
Symptoms of a speech disorder can include repeating or prolonging sounds, rearranging syllables, and speaking very softly.
The symptoms of speech disorders vary widely depending on the cause and severity of the disorder. People can develop multiple speech disorders with different symptoms.

People with one or more speech disorders may experience the following symptoms:

repeating or prolonging sounds
distorting sounds
adding sounds or syllables to words
rearranging syllables
having difficulty pronouncing words correctly
struggling to say the correct word or sound
speaking with a hoarse or raspy voice
speaking very softly
Causes
Causes of speech disorders can include:

brain damage due to a stroke or head injury
muscle weakness
damaged vocal cords
a degenerative disease, such as Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
dementia
cancer that affects the mouth or throat
autism
Down syndrome
hearing loss
Risk factors that can increase the likelihood of a person developing a speech disorder include:

being male
being born prematurely
having a low weight at birth
having a family history of speech disorders
experiencing problems that affect the ears, nose, or throat
