       Neurological Vision Impairment is the term used to describe a vision impairment caused by damage
to the brain, such as a stroke (cerebro-vascular accident - CVA), tumour, brain injury or
pathological degenerative disease.
Vision impairment is generally thought of as damage to or deterioration of the eyes. There are
many different areas of the brain that interpret what our eyes see. When these are damaged, the
eyes may still function but the message might be misinterpreted or unable to get through to the
brain resulting in NVI.
People with brain injuries may not always be aware that their vision is impaired.
The most common example of NVI is a visual field deficit often referred to as a Homonymous
Hemianopia. Often people who have this condition will believe that they are blind in one eye. This
is not so. There is usually an impairment to either the left or right visual fields of each eye.
Unfortunately neither glasses nor eye surgery will restore sight for a person with a NVI.
 6/6 Vision Homonymous Hemianopia
Some functional implications of Homonymous Hemianopia are:
 seeing only half of an image or person’s face
 bumping into objects on the side of the impaired field of vision
 missing half the food on a plate
 walking past doorways or landmarks and becoming disoriented as a result
 being startled by people and objects suddenly appearing from the deficit field of vision
 completely missing or misreading street signs
 feeling uncertain and anxious when travelling in crowded areas
 experiencing difficulty in reading due to ineffective scanning across a page of print
The person with NVI may alleviate these difficulties by being taught compensatory scanning
techniques.
